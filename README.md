Goal
----
The goal of the project is to achieve the following  
- Use [git hooks](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) to automatically test builds on commit/merge/rebase
- Use [Docker](http://docker.io) to run the build script in a container
- Run test script in the container. If tests pass, allow to download the image as tarball or push the container image either to the [public index](http://index.docker.io) or a private index
- Give a dashboard to configure/analyze builds
- Allow adding customized plugins
